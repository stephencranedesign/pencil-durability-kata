# Pencil Durability Kata
This is a practice project with the purpose of writing code to simulate, first coarsely and then more faithfully, an ordinary graphite pencil. It includes writing and editing text, point degradation, using the eraser, and sharpening the pencil. The point of this kata is to provide a larger-than-trivial exercise that can be used to practice TDD.
